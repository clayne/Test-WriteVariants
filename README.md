# NAME

Test::WriteVariants - Dynamic generation of tests in nested combinations of contexts

# SYNOPSIS

    use Test::WriteVariants;

    my $test_writer = Test::WriteVariants->new();

    $test_writer->write_test_variants(

        # tests we want to run in various contexts
        input_tests => {
            'core/10-foo' => { require => 't/core/10-foo.t' },
            'core/20-bar' => { require => 't/core/20-bar.t' },
        },

        # one or more providers of variant contexts
        variant_providers => [
            sub {
                my ($path, $context, $tests) = @_;
                my %variants = (
                    plain    => $context->new_env_var(MY_MODULE_PUREPERL => 0),
                    pureperl => $context->new_env_var(MY_MODULE_PUREPERL => 1),
                );
                return %variants;
            },
            sub {
                my ($path, $context, $tests) = @_;
                my %variants = map {
                    $_ => $context->new_env_var(MY_MODULE_WIBBLE => $_),
                } 1..3;
                delete $variants{3} if $context->get_env_var("MY_MODULE_PUREPERL");
                return %variants;
            },
        ],

        # where to generate the .t files that wrap the input_tests
        output_dir => 't/variants',
    );

When run that generates the desired test variants:

    Writing t/variants/plain/1/core/10-foo.t
    Writing t/variants/plain/1/core/20-bar.t
    Writing t/variants/plain/2/core/10-foo.t
    Writing t/variants/plain/2/core/20-bar.t
    Writing t/variants/plain/3/core/10-foo.t
    Writing t/variants/plain/3/core/20-bar.t
    Writing t/variants/pureperl/1/core/10-foo.t
    Writing t/variants/pureperl/1/core/20-bar.t
    Writing t/variants/pureperl/2/core/10-foo.t
    Writing t/variants/pureperl/2/core/20-bar.t

Here's what t/variants/pureperl/2/core/20-bar.t looks like:

    #!perl
    $ENV{MY_MODULE_WIBBLE} = 2;
    END { delete $ENV{MY_MODULE_WIBBLE} } # for VMS
    $ENV{MY_MODULE_PUREPERL} = 1;
    END { delete $ENV{MY_MODULE_PUREPERL} } # for VMS
    require 't/core/20-bar.t';

Here's an example that uses plugins to provide the tests and the variants:

    my $test_writer = Test::WriteVariants->new();

    # gather set of input tests that we want to run in various contexts
    # these can come from various sources, including modules and test files
    my $input_tests = $test_writer->find_input_test_modules(
        search_path => [ 'DBI::TestCase' ]
    );

    $test_writer->write_test_variants(

        # tests we want to run in various contexts
        input_tests => $input_tests,

        # one or more providers of variant contexts
        # (these can be code refs or plugin namespaces)
        variant_providers => [
            "DBI::Test::VariantDBI",
            "DBI::Test::VariantDriver",
            "DBI::Test::VariantDBD",
        ],

        # where to generate the .t files that wrap the input_tests
        output_dir => $output_dir,
    );

# DESCRIPTION

NOTE: This is alpha code that's still evolving - nothing is stable.

See [List::MoreUtils](https://metacpan.org/pod/List::MoreUtils) (on github) for an example use.

# METHODS

## new

    $test_writer = Test::WriteVariants->new(%attributes);

Instanciates a Test::WriteVariants instance and sets the specified attributes, if any.

## allow\_dir\_overwrite

    $test_writer->allow_dir_overwrite($bool);
    $bool = $test_writer->allow_dir_overwrite;

If the output directory already exists when tumble() is called it'll
throw an exception (and warn if it wasn't created during the run).
Setting allow\_dir\_overwrite true disables this safety check.

## allow\_file\_overwrite

    $test_writer->allow_file_overwrite($bool);
    $bool = $test_writer->allow_file_overwrite;

If the test file that's about to be written already exists
then write\_output\_files() will throw an exception.
Setting allow\_file\_overwrite true disables this safety check.

## write\_test\_variants

    $test_writer->write_test_variants(
        input_tests => \%input_tests,
        variant_providers => \@variant_providers,
        output_dir => $output_dir,
    );

Instanciates a [Data::Tumbler](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Tumbler). Sets its `consumer` to call:

    $self->write_output_files($path, $context, $payload, $output_dir)

and sets its `add_context` to call:

    $context->new($context, $item);

and then calls its `tumble` method:

    $tumbler->tumble(
        $self->normalize_providers($variant_providers),
        [],
        Test::WriteVariants::Context->new(),
        $input_tests,
    );

## find\_input\_test\_modules

    $input_tests = $test_writer->find_input_test_modules(
        search_path => ["Helper"],
        search_dirs => "t/lib",
        test_prefix => "Extra::Helper",
        input_tests => $input_tests
    );

## find\_input\_test\_files

Not yet implemented - will file .t files.

## find\_input\_inline\_tests

    $input_tests = $test_writer->find_input_inline_tests(
        search_pattern => ["*.it"],
        search_dirs => "t/inl",
        input_tests => $input_tests
    );

## add\_test

    $test_writer->add_test(
        $input_tests,   # the \%input_tests to add the test module to
        $test_name,     # the key to use in \%input_tests
        $test_spec      # the details of the test file
    );

Adds the $test\_spec to %$input\_tests keys by $test\_name. In other words:

    $input_tests->{ $test_name } = $test_spec;

An exception will be thrown if a test with $test\_name already exists
in %$input\_tests.

This is a low-level interface that's not usually called directly.
See ["add\_test\_module"](#add_test_module).

## add\_test\_module

    $test_writer->add_test_module(
        $input_tests,     # the \%input_tests to add the test module to
        $module_name,     # the package name of the test module
        $edit_test_name   # a code ref to edit the test module name in $_
    );

## add\_test\_inline

    $test_writer->add_test_inline(
        $input_tests,     # the \%input_tests to add the test module to
        $file_name,       # the file name of the test code to inline
        $edit_test_name   # a code ref to edit the test file name in $_
    );

## normalize\_providers

    $providers = $test_writer->normalize_providers($providers);

Given a reference to an array of providers, returns a reference to a new array.
Any code references in the original array are passed through unchanged.

Any other value is treated as a package name and passed to
[Module::Pluggable::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Pluggable::Object) as a namespace `search_path` to find plugins.
An exception is thrown if no plugins are found.

The corresponding element of the original $providers array is replaced with a
new provider code reference which calls the `provider_initial`, `provider`,
and `provider_final` methods, if present, for each plugin namespace in turn.

Normal [Data::Tumbler](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Tumbler) provider subroutines are called with these arguments:

    ($path, $context, $tests)

and the return value is expected to be a hash.  Whereas the plugin provider
methods are called with these arguments:

    ($test_writer, $path, $context, $tests, $variants)

and the return value is ignored. The $variants argument is a reference to a
hash that will be returned to Data::Tumbler and which should be edited by the
plugin provider method. This allows a plugin to see, and change, the variants
requested by any other plugins that have already been run for this provider.

## write\_output\_files

    $test_writer->write_output_files($path, $context, $input_tests, $output_dir);

Writes test files for each test in %$input\_tests, for the given $path and $context,
into the $output\_dir.

The $output\_dir, @$path, and key of %$input\_tests are concatenated to form a
file name. A ".t" is added if not already present.

Calls ["get\_test\_file\_body"](#get_test_file_body) to get the content of the test file, and then
calls ["write\_file"](#write_file) to write it.

## write\_file

    $test_writer->write_file($filepath, $content);

Throws an exception if $filepath already exists and ["allow\_file\_overwrite"](#allow_file_overwrite) is
not true.

Creates $filepath and writes $content to it.
Creates any directories that are needed.
Throws an exception on error.

## get\_test\_file\_body

    $test_body = $test_writer->get_test_file_body($context, $test_spec);

XXX This should probably be a method call on an object
instanciated by the find\_input\_test\_\* methods.
